BIDMat is a set of Scala, Java and native code libraries. To run it, you need:

* A java runtime, version 1.5 or later.

* An Installation of the Scala language, which you can get from here: http://www.scala-lang.org/

* A 64bit Intel machine (Linux, Windows, and *soon* Mac), if you plan to use any native
  code acceleration. You should set Mat.noMKL=true in scala if you dont have one. A lot of
  the code will still work, but that's really not the point of the library.

* To use these libraries with a CUDA GPU, you need a CUDA-enabled GPU device and the
  [http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-downloads NVIDIA driver with CUDA support and the
  CUDA Toolkit] from the NVIDIA website.

Ideally, you should use a Kepler architecture GPU (GTX 670, 680 or 690, or K10). The Jcuda
code will run on older GPUs, but our custom kernels are developed specifically for >=
Kepler.

In Linux, you should just be able to run the "bidmat" script from the top-level
directory. If that doesnt work, its probably because $JAVA_HOME is not set in your
environment. You can set it inside the script instead.

On windows you will need to set the system PATH variable to include the lib subdirectory,
which is at <root_dir>/BIDMat/lib/win64, and which contains the native code dlls
