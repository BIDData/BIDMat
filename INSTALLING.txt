BIDMat is a set of Scala, Java and native code libraries. To run it, you need:

* A java runtime, version 1.5 or later.

* An Installation of the Scala language, which you can get from here: http://www.scala-lang.org/
  You need Scala 2.9.1 or later. We have tested extensively on 2.9.1 and 2.9.2.

* A 64bit Intel machine (Linux, Windows, and *soon* Mac), if you plan to use any native
  code acceleration. We have tested on Windows 7 and RedHat Enterprise Linux 6. 
  You should set Mat.noMKL=true in scala if you dont have one. A lot of
  the code will still work, but that's really not the point of the library.

* To use these libraries with a CUDA GPU, you need a CUDA-enabled GPU device. The code has
  been developed for GTX 600-series, and this is the ideal platform. The code should work
  with Tesla K10 devices, which share the same GPU chip as the 680/690 which is our
  main platform. Most operations will work also with 500-series and we are working to add
  the others. 

* You need the [http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-downloads NVIDIA CUDA driver and the
  CUDA Toolkit] from the NVIDIA website. This version is based on CUDA 4.2. CUDA 5.0 supported
  should appear soon. 

In Linux, you should just be able to run the "bidmat" script from the top-level
directory. If that doesnt work, its probably because $JAVA_HOME is not set in your
environment. You can set it inside the script instead.

On windows you will need to set the system PATH variable to include the lib subdirectory,
which is at <root_dir>/BIDMat/lib/win64, and which contains the native code dlls
