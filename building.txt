Building
=====================

Building requires the Intel C++ Compiler

All
---
Install new CUDA version

Download JCUDA from http://www.jcuda.org/

Copy updated JCUDA shared libs into BIDMat/lib 

edit bidmat script to change JCUDA_VERSION

Download ptplot from the URL below and copy ptolemy/plot/*.jar into BIDMat/lib
http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/ptplot5.10/ptolemy/plot/doc/index.htm

Compile jni/src:
./configure
then ensure that Makefile.inc points to your JDK header include path, and then
make
make install

Ensure Intel's libiomp5.so library is in your LD_LIBRARY path

and then:
./sbt package

test with:
./sbt test

If compiling MatKernel.cu breaks on the sorting functions, check 
the CUDA path for radixsort_api.h and update the namespace line as
path XX/YY/ZZ ==> namespace XX::YY::ZZ

Windows
-------
fix %CUDA_*% environment variables on your machine, these were broken in 5.5

Have to hardwire cudart lib numbers in Mat.checkCUDA :-(
