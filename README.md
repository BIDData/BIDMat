BIDMat is a very fast matric algebra library. Check the latest <b><a href="https://github.com/BIDData/BIDMach/wiki/Benchmarks">benchmarks</a></b>

The github distribution contains source code only. To build the system, you need a Java JDK 8, an installation of CUDA 8.0 (if you want to use NVIDIA GPUs), and a copy of <b><a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">apache maven 3.x</a></b>. On windows, you also need a unix command package like <b><a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a></b>. With those prerequisites, you can do:
<pre>
mvn clean install
</pre>
to build and install and then
<pre>
./bidmat
</pre>
To start bidmat. More detailed installation and building instructions are available <a href="https://github.com/BIDData/BIDMat/wiki/Installation">here</a>.
